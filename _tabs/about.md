## Bio
Saket is a passionate computer science research student with experience in academic and industrial cybersecurity research. He holds two patents and four copyrights for his work on Nature-Inspired Cyber Security. His work has been published in high-impact research publications. He is very enthusiastic about teaching and research and plans to join academia as a lecturer after his doctorate from the University of Virginia, USA. His current research interest lies in Low-level software security, Hardware Security, Malware Analysis, Threat Intelligence, and Nature Inspired approach.

His work on Android Malware analysis and threat intelligence titled “PACE: Platform for Android Malware Classification and Performance Evaluation” was awarded the “Best Paper Award” at The 3rd International Workshop on Big Data Analytic for Cyber Crime Investigation and Prevention, IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2019, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

He has been particularly curious about low-level security, assembly language, reverse engineering, and hardware security and plans to explore them during his Ph.D.;

Some of the topics that he wants to explore more profoundly are (not limited to)-
1. Low-Level software security.
2. Sub Ring-0 Security and Privilege Escalation.
3. Malware Detection and Analysis.
4. Processor security.
5. Low-energy computing hardware security.

## Education History
I am a researcher and an academician, worked in the security industry for a while, and did some projects with the government, but still, I am a student first.

I completed my Higher Secondary School (12th Grade) from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendriya_Vidyalaya_Sangathan">Kendriya Vidyalaya</a>, Nashik, Maharashtra, India; in 2018 and then started my Undergraduate college in the same year.

I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics from <a class="link" href="https://vitbhopal.ac.in/">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) University</a>, India [Bhopal Campus]. Here I got familiarized with academic and industrial research by my amazing profs. 
I completed my Undergrad in 2022 and started my Graduate school in the same year.

I got accepted into the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the <a class="link" href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>, Charlottesville, VA, US; in February 2022 for subsequent fall semester (Aug. 2022) intake.


My area of curiosity is cybersecurity, specifically, low-level security, malware reverse engineering, and analysis, hardware security, and nature-inspired approach.


Since the start of my undergrad, I've been particularly curious about low-level security, assembly language, reverse engineering, and hardware security. Even though I was not able to put my hands on some of these topics then, I plan to explore them during my first year of Ph.D.; UVa has the people and resources to make it happen.
Some of the topics that I want to explore more profoundly are (not limited to)-
1. Low-Level software security.
2. Sub Ring-0 Security and Privilege Escalation.
3. Malware Detection and Analysis.
4. Processor security.
5. Low-energy computing hardware security.
