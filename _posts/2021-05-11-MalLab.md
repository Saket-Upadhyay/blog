**C**reating your own malware analysis lab can be time consuming and hectic, to setup all the tools required might take 2–3 days if not a whole week for a beginner.
It took me 2 weeks to develop a stable malware analysis lab when I was getting started, finding all the tools, automation scripts and even setting up a VM was a challenge.
So I’ve created a complete VM pre-installed will all the required tools and an activated development copy of windows10 for 90 days which you can simply import in your computer in mere clicks.

# Pre-installation requirements
1. You need stable internet connection to download ~16.2GB data.
2. Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education (Only they have Hypervisor installed)
3. 64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).
4. CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension (VT-c / VT-x on Intel CPUs).
5. Minimum of 4 GB memory
6. ~100GB free storage space.
7. 7zip archive manager to extract .7z file, you can download this for free from [HERE](https://www.7-zip.org/)

# Activate Hyper Visor
Search for Hyper-V Manager in your windows search you should get something like —

If you don’t see it, you may need to enable it. Follow the official guide below to do so [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)

Once this is done, we can start our main endeavor.

# Download the VM package
This is the only part where you will need internet data to download a large file (16GiB), this is my compressed export files from my own setup.
Go to the GitHub repository given below and click the download link, if I ever change my file location, it will be updated here so it will be always available to you no matter when you are reading this post.
